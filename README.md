# Mood Monitor
Mood Monitor is an webapp to track your days.
It is just like a diary just with MOODS!
Mood Monitor was a school project done during 2 semester.
It uses Angular as a frontend framework.
In the backend it uses node.js with express to run a rest service.
As a DB we used the NoSQL database MongoDB.

# How to run
You need to clone this project and also the [Server](https://github.com/SavoVuksan/MoodMonitorServer)
and you need MongoDB installed on your machine.

In the project folder you just need to run 2 commands:
1. `npm install`
1. `ng serve`

and then the frontend should be running.
